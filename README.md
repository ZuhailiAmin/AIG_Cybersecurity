# AIG Shields Up: Cybersecurity Job Simulation - My Experience üëæ

## Introduction
This readme reflects on my personal participation in the AIG Shields Up: Cybersecurity Job Simulation. Throughout this simulation, I had the opportunity to explore various facets of cybersecurity, honing both non-technical and technical skills. The primary tasks included responding to a zero-day vulnerability and developing a technical solution for bypassing ransomware. Here's a breakdown of my experience:

## Task One: Responding to a Zero-Day Vulnerability üö®

### What I Learned
- Addressing vulnerabilities affecting Product Development Staging Environment infrastructure.

### My Actions
1. Reviewed recent publications from CISA.
2. Researched the Apache Log4j zero-day vulnerability.
3. Drafted an advisory email to alert affected teams, providing insights and remediation steps.

### Background
In my role as an Information Security Analyst within the Cyber & Information Security Team, staying informed about emerging vulnerabilities is critical. This task allowed me to apply my knowledge and communicate effectively with relevant teams at AIG.

### My Approach
- Conducted a thorough review of CISA advisories on Log4j and ransomware.
- Crafted an advisory email following the provided template, addressing the Log4j zero-day vulnerability.

## Task Two: (Technical) Bypassing Ransomware üîí

### What I Learned
- Understanding 'bruteforcing.'
- Responding to a ransomware virus using Python.

### My Actions
- Wrote a Python script to bruteforce the decryption key of the encrypted file.

### Background
After the Log4j vulnerability advisory, an attacker attempted to install ransomware. My task was to write a Python script to bruteforce the decryption key, avoiding the need to pay the ransom.

### My Approach
- Utilized the provided Python script template.
- Implemented a bruteforce approach to decrypt the ransomware-encrypted file.

### Conclusion
Participating in the AIG Shields Up: Cybersecurity Job Simulation was an enriching experience that allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. The tasks not only honed my technical skills but also improved my communication abilities in a cybersecurity context. I feel better equipped to address similar challenges in a professional setting. üåê
